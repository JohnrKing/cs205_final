# TODO: Modify this file to create a shell script that is able to use awk to go through a file formatted like best_pokemon.dat and provides a printed report in the following format (where your script correctly calculates the values that go into the [VALUE] placeholders):
filename=$1
total=$(awk 'END {print NR}' $filename)
avg_hp=$(awk '{sum += $3} END {print sum / NR}' $filename)
avg_attack=$(awk '{sum += $4} END {print sum / NR}' $filename)
echo "===== SUMMARY OF DATA FILE ====="
echo "filename: $filename"
echo "Total Pokemon: $total"
echo "Avg. HP: $avg_hp"
echo "Avg. Attack: $avg_attack"
echo "===== END SUMMARY ====="


# The "Avg." values should be calculated as mean values for the corresponding columns.
# The spacing and header formatting should match the above formatting description exactly.
# There should be a comment explaining the purpose of each line in your shell script. 
# The data file will be passed in to the script as a positional parameter and will not necessarily be called best_pokemon.dat. However, you can assume that any file passed to this script will be formatted exactly the way best_pokemon.dat is formatted.
